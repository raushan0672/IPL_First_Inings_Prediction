# IPL_First_Inings_Prediction

About

This project predicts the first-innings score in IPL matches using ball-by-ball data. The dataset had around 76,000 deliveries, and I applied regression models to check how well they could estimate the final score.


Steps I Followed

Cleaned the dataset (removed extra columns, kept consistent teams, fixed dates)

Used features like overs, runs scored, and wickets

Trained models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Evaluated models using MAE, MSE, RMSE


Results

The models gave fairly good predictions

Random Forest performed the best

Found that early wickets and run rate strongly affect the final score
